* LaunchyQt
- original code forked from https://sourceforge.net/projects/launchy
- svn path https://svn.code.sf.net/p/launchy/code/trunk/Launchy_QT [R671]

** Reason for this repo
I have been using Launchy for years, and found that this project has not been updated since 2010. I love this tool and want to reactivate this project.

** Latest release
*3.0.0 alpha* Changes:
- Qt5.11.1, It's 2018 now, migrated to Qt higher version.
- non- =boost= dependency, C++11 supports =shared_ptr= , and I'm trying to get Launchy out of =boost= library.
- whole new hotkey implemetation, the hotkey did not work, I tried hard to fix it, but it still failed, so I write a new one.
