* how to build

** Windows with Visual Studio 2015
*** Environments
Here is what I am using for development and release build.
- Visual Studio Community 2015 ([[https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%2520studio%25202015&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads][download page]])
- Qt5.11.1 ([[https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.11/5.11.1/][download page]])
- Qt-VS-addin msvc2015 ([[https://download.qt.io/official_releases/vsaddin/][downlaod page]])
- Python3.6.7 x86_64 ([[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/][download page]])

*** Configuration
After you have all the above installed, you need to:
1. Configure qt-vs-addin to the qt path. I recommend to set name to "Qt5.11.1x64" in the Qt Version panel, because this name will be stored in "Launchy.sln". This [[http://doc.qt.io/archives/vs-addin/vs-addin-managing-projects.html][qt official manual]] maight help.
2. Change launchy solution's Qt version to what you have just configured in step 1.
3. Add "PYTHONPATH" in user environment variables, the value should be the path that you installed python.

*** Build and debug
Now you can build and debug Launchy.
*Tips:*
1. You should build in "Release x64" configuration
2. Even when you are debugging, you should still use release configuration, because we have installed python in release, [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/working-with-c-cpp-python-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2017][this page]] have more detailed information about VS working with python.
3. When debugging in release configuration, you may see "unwanted fast jumps" when stepping the code, this is because of compile optimization, and you can turn it off temporary in project property panel.
