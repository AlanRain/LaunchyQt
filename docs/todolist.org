* To do list
develop planing and idea will be recorded here

- !! make a complete function build in windows
- windows platform use  win32 + qt (do not use mfc or atl)
- code structure is so wild, try to reorder them
- windows platform version will develop first, linux and mac will come second
- use QSingleApplication to solve the single instance problem
- use 3rd party log infrastructure to record logs
- evaluate plugin system, any better solutions?
